Known issues:

- Naming Mistakes (e.g. Berlin "PRO DOUBLES - Overall" is called "DOUBLES - Overall" in the drop down). Caught in logic,
  but ugly...
- Inconsistent Event IDs (Heerenven 2025 Adaptive Overall ID has name "Doubles Overall" and doesn't shoe the Adaptive
  overall results) Caught in logic, but ugly...
- Elite Divisions: Sometimes called "Elite", "Elite Pro", "Elite 15" TODO: Find a solution (Maybe just "Elite" and "
  Doubles Elite")
- Melbourne 2024: Two races (June/December) under the same race name "Melbourne 2024" -> Each Division is doubled: Need
  to find a way to split them (add date or sth) and assign the divisions to a different event.
